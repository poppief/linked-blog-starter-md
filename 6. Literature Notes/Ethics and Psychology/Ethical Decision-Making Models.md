**Kitchener** developed one of the first and most influential models, which described two levels of moral reasoning:
1. Intuitive level
2. Critical-Evaluative Level 

**Haas and Malouf** developed a particularly extensive and detailed model, characterising it as an attempt to describe the process that naturally occurs when making ethical decisions.

Most models view nonrational thoughts or influences as impurities in a purely rational process rather than inherent and inevitable components of any cognitive task
- Due to this, many of these models of ethical reasoning are vulnerable to subjectivity, bias, and rationalisation
