**Purposes of the code:**
- To unify the practices of the profession
- To guide psychologists in ethical decision-making.
- To provide guidelines for the public to inform them of the profession's ethics (using the summary version of the Code).

Psychologists should consider the Code when making decisions about professional and research practice.
- They should also take into account workplace codes of conduct, codes of practice, and relevant legislation.
- If the Code of Ethics sets a higher standard of conduct than legislation or other codes, psychologists should adopt the higher ethical standard in their decisions.

The Code of Ethics identifies *four ethical principles:*
1. [[Respect for the dignity of persons and peoples]]
2. [[Responsible Caring]]
3. [[Integrity In Relationships]]
4. [[Social Justice and Responsibility to Society]]

Each principle encompasses several Values.
- These Values are connected to Practice Implications, which outline appropriate professional behaviours related to that Value
Practice Implications are guides to practice and do not exhaust the implications of the associated value for practice

In all circumstances when making ethical decisions:
- **Identify the issues and practices that are ethically relevant.**
- **Develop alternative courses of action**, preferably in consultation with a professional colleague or supervisor.
- **For each identified course of action, analyze the likely short-term, ongoing, and long-term risks and benefits** for the individual(s) and/or group(s) involved or likely to be affected.
- **Conscientiously apply the principles, values, and practice implications** to each course of action in light of the identified risks and benefits and decide which offers the best balance between these.
- **Take the chosen course of action, accepting responsibility** for the consequences of the chosen course of action.
- **Evaluate the consequences of the action**, correcting negative outcomes if possible and, if the issue(s) originally identified are not resolved, re-engage in the decision-making process.
