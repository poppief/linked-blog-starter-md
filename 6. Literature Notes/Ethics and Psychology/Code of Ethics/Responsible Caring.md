**Principle 2**
The practice of Psychology promotes well-being. In pursuing this goal, psychologists demonstrate:
- An active concern for the welfare of those with whom they work
- Psychologists acknowledge the social and institutional power that structures their role
- Psychologists have a primary responsibility to protect teh welfare of those with whom they work
- Psychologists recognize that individuals, families, groups, hapū/iwi, or communities may be in a vulnerable position
- In New Zealand, the Treaty of Waitangi provides a framework for responsible caring between the two peoples, tangata whenua and those who are not Māori.

Value 2.1 ***Promotion of Wellbeing***
- *Value Statement:* Psychologists recognise that a basic ethical expectation of our discipline is that its activities will benefit members of society or, at the very least, do not harm
- *Practice Implications:*
	- 2.1.1 Psychologists assess the potential harm and benefits involved in their actions, predicting the likelihood of their occurrence, and proceed only if the potential benefits outweigh the potential harms. They endeavour to correct any harmful effects that have occurred because of their activities
	- 2.1.2 Psychologists use the most respectful and effective interventions or strategies for those with whom they are working
	- 2.1.3Psychologists who conduct psychological assessments select appropriate procedures and instruments and can justify their use and interpretation 
		- This involves, but is not limited to, selection of procedures and instruments with established scientific status, currency, and cultural appropriateness, and which the psychologist is trained to administer. Any reservations concerning the validity or reliability of an assessment procedure, arising from its administration, norms, or domain-reference, should be made explicit in any report.
	- 2.1.4 In reporting assessment findings and recommendations to clients, research participants, and/or professionals, psychologists provide appropriate explanations of findings, interpretations, and limitations. They endeavour to ensure these are not misused.
		- Uninterpreted data from assessments is not normally released to persons who are not specifically trained in the use and interpretation of the instruments concerned
		- With respect to children/young persons especially, it should be recognised that they have the capacity for considerable change through their development. Labels about thier current level of skills or emotional maturity can stereotype them and impede their future capacity to mature. Caution should be exercised in using diagnostic labels. 
	- 2.1.5 Psychologists do not delegate activities to persons not competent to carry them out
	- 2.1.6 When a client's needs lie outside of a psychologist's expertise, the psychologist refers the client to other appropriate services
		- If referring a client to a colleague or other professional, psychologists maintain appropriate contact, support, and responsibility for caring until a colleague or other professional begins service
	- 2.1.7 Once a professional relationship has been established, psychologists provide services until the relationship is properly terminated. Proper termination of a professional relationship should occur with due regard to the client’s needs.
	- 2.1.8 When it is clear that the client is not benefiting, a psychologist initiates a termination of the professional relationship.
		- Such termination of a professional relationship is, where possible, negotiated with the client. When appropriate, help is given to the client to find alternative sources of assistance.
	- 2.1.9 In a professional relationship, psychologists do not foster dependence on the psychologist.
		- This applies to clients, supervisees, and students 
	- 2.1.10 Sexual relationships with clients, supervisees, and/or students are unethical. Psychologists do not encourage or engage in sexual intimacy, either during the time of that professional relationship, or for that period of time following during which the power relationship could be expected to influence personal decision making
		- It is not appropriate to terminate a professional relationship in order to facilitate an intimate relationship 
	- 2.1.11 Psychologists try to stop clearly harmful activities being carried out by another psychologist or another professional 
		- When these activities come to the attention of psychologists, the psychologists’ actions may include talking informally with the psychologist or member of another profession, formally recording concerns, obtaining objective information and, if possible, the assurance that the harm will discontinue and be corrected, reporting to the appropriate regulatory body, authority, and/or committee for action.
	- 2.1.12 Psychologists do everything reasonable to stop or offset the consequences of actions by others when these actions are likely to result in serious physical harm or death
		- This may include reporting to appropriate authorities (e.g., the police) or an intended victim or other relevant people, and this would be done even when a confidential relationship is involved ( refer to [[1.6.10]])
	- 2.1.13 When Psychologists are aware that clients are involved with more than one service provider, they endeavour to provide services that are coordinated over time and avoid duplication or conflict
		- Such coordination should be promoted by the maintenance of adequate records and communication with other service providers within limitations of confidentiality and consent (refer to [[1.6.9]])

Value 2.2 ***Competence
- *Value Statement:* Psychologists attain and maintain competency
- *Practice Implications:*
	- 2.2.1 Psychologists attain and maintain adequate levels of knowledge and skills to practise in a particular area
	- 2.2.2 Psychologists recognise the limits of their competence and provide only those services for which they are competent, based on their education, training, supervised experience, or appropriate professional experience
	- 2.2.3 Psychologists practice in new areas of psychology or utilise new techniques, only after undertaking appropriate study, training, supervision, and/or consultation from persons who are competent in those areas or techniques
	- 2.2.4 Psychologists utilise and rely on scientifically and professionally derived knowledge, and are able to justify their professional decisions and activities in the light of current psychological knowledge and standards of practice
	- [[2.2.5]] Psychologists seek to maintain an awareness of how their own experiences, attitudes, culture, beliefs, values, social context, individual differences, and stresses influence their interactions with others, and integrate this awareness into all aspects of their work.
	- [[2.2.6]] Psychologists have regular supervision and undertake regular evaluation of their work to ensure quality services.
	- 2.2.7 Psychologists have a responsibility to monitor their ability to work effectively to avoid conditions that could result in impaired judgement and interfere with their ability to practise safely. They seek appropriate help and/or discontinue scientific or professional activity for an appropriate period if a physical or psychological condition reduces their ability to work effectively and maintain safe practice.

Value 2.3 ***Active Participation***
- *Value* *Statement*:  Psychologists recognise that clients should actively participate in decisions that affect their welfare 
- *Practice Implications:*
	- 2.3.1 Psychologists provide clients with adequate information, time, and support to enable active participation in decisions that affect their welfare. This information includes assessments of benefits and harms so they can appreciate the likely consequences of working with the psychologist.

Value 2.4 ***Vulnerability** 
- *Value Statement:* Psychologists especially provide responsible care to individuals and groups who may be disadvantaged and/or oppressed
- *Practice Implications:*
	- 2.4.1 Recognise vulnerability, acknowledge the vulnerability of certain individuals, groups, or communities and act accordingly 
	- 2.4.2 Psychologists should recognise that vulnerability increases in unfamiliar cultural or clinical settings, with unfamiliar languages, large numbers of staff, or lack of advocate support 
	- 2.4.3 Reducing vulnerabilities: psychologists strive to implement supports that reduce vulnerabilities 
	- 2.4.4 Accomodating unchangeable vulnerabilities, when vulnerabilities cannot be lessened, psychologists should account for this in their work with the affected individuals, groups, families, or communities
	- 2.4.5 Aversive strategies should only be used as a last resort after all less intrusive alternatives have been exhausted within a positive intervention program
		- Informed consent should be obtained where possible, and ongoing evaluation and supervision should ensure the continued justification of aversive strategies.
Value 2.5 ***Children/Young persons***
- *Value statement:* psychologists recognise the vulnerable status of children 
- *Practice Implications:*
	- 2.5.1 Psychologists take account of the developmental level of children/young persons and do not exploit them in any way
	- 2.5.2 In research with children/young persons, psychologists take stringent care to achieve informed consent from guardians and assent from the child/young person
Value 2.6 ***Well-being of Human Research Participants***
- *Value Statement:* In carrying out research, psychologists recognise that a basic ethical expectation is that research activities will benefit members of society or, at least, do no harm
- *Practice Implications:*
	- 2.6.1 Psychologists conduct research that is ethically sound and meets current standards for research design adequacy 
	- 2.6.2 Research proposals are submitted for ethical review to an appropriately constituted ethical review committee
		- Proposals should address responsiveness to the Treaty principles of partnership, participation, and protection and be compatible with Māori development
	- 2.6.3 Psychologists avoid research procedures that are likely to cause serious or lasting harm to participants
	- 2.6.4 All reasonable steps are taken to protect participants from physical and mental discomfort or danger
		- If risks exist and participants give informed consent, all possible steps must be taken to minimize these risks
	- 2.6.5 Psychologists account for the developmental immaturity of children and avoid exploiting or manipulating them in research
	- 2.6.6 Psychologists debrief participants in a way that allows any harm caused to be identified and corrected
		- This should be done in a comprehensible manner
	- 2.6.7 Findings are communicated to participants in ways that value and respect their contribution
Value 2.7 ***Animals***
- *Value Statement:* Psychologists treatment and use of animals in their research and teaching must be humane 
- *Practice Implications:*
	- 2.7.1 Psychologists conduct research with animals that is ethically sound and meets current standards for research design adequacy 
	- 2.7.2 Research proposals involving animals are submitted for ethical review to an appropriately constituted ethical review committee
		- Psychologists using procedures that may subject animals to discomfort must justify these risks on scientific grounds to the ethics committee
