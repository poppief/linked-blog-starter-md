**Principle 1**
This principle requires:
- Each person and all peoples to be positively valued in their own right.
- Each person and all peoples to be shown respect and granted dignity as part of their common humanity.
- Sensitivity to cultural and social diversity.
- Recognition of differences among persons based on their culture, nationality, ethnicity, colour, race, religion, gender, marital status, sexual orientation, physical or mental abilities, age, socio-economic status, or any other personal characteristic, condition, or status.
- Understanding that such differences are an integral part of the person.

**In New Zealand:**

- The basis for respect between the indigenous people (tangata whenua – those who are Māori) and others (those who are not Māori) is set out in the Treaty of Waitangi.

		- Te Tiriti o Waitangi should be prioritized as it was the text offered to and signed by the majority of Māori signatories

	- Psychologists seek to be responsible to cultural and social diversity, obtaining training, experience, and advice to ensure competent and culturally safe service or research
		- "Advice" includes guidance from a cultural adviser appropriate to the context. Competent service may require the provision of an interpreter where there are language barriers
