Psychologists can improve decision-making by considering a broader array of factors that can influence judgment and decisions.

Research has shown that when faced with ethical dilemmas, clinicians often report that they act in ways that depart from how they believe they should.

There is a discrepancy between ethical reasoning and ethical behaviour

Decisions tend to be based on our subjective experience of the world.

The manner in which a situation is framed can have a large impact on the decision made

People tend to be risk averse when considering potential gains and risk seeking when trying to avoid potential losses

Heuristics may influence the interpretation of diagnostic information and statistical results that are vital in assessing a clinical, scientific, or ethical question
- [[availability heuristic]]
- [[Anchoring]]
- [[Representativeness heuristic]]
- [[Confirmation Bias]]
- [[Bias blind spot]]
- [[Affect heuristic]]
- [[Self-serving Bias]]
Pre-existing notions anchor subsequent reasoning and can affect information gathering analysis, and retrieval in the face of an ethical dilemma. For example, believing a colleague generally to be an ethical researcher may unduly influence the evaluation of specific troublesome behaviours
Heuristics can be helpful but they often lead to widespread bias
- For example, a clinician may easily be able to recall the times in which a certain intervention resulted in remarkable improvement in a patient's symptoms, but may not recall the other times that the intervention was ineffectual and counterproductive

If psychologists are reminded of their professional identity and responsibilities, they may be more likely to analyze information more effectively and make cautious decisions

The APA (2002) 'Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct' states:
Psychologists avoid professional roles if personal, scientific, professional, legal, financial, or other interests or relationships might:

1. Compromise their objectivity, competence, or effectiveness.
2. Risk harming or exploiting the person or organization involved.

Emotions may be useful in signalling the presence of conflicting principles or direct attention to considerations that otherwise might be neglected

[[Prospect theory]] holds implications, for example: after contemplating the effects of losing a lucrative grant, a researcher may be tempted toward more professionally risky and unethical practices—such as “cherry-picking” data and even falsifying results—to avert the termination of a project that she or he believes to have considerable potential benefits for society.

[[Fundamental attribution error]] is influential in numerous domains, and professional psychologists are not immune to its effects. For example: *Dr. Rodriguez was interviewing a patient who expressed great appreciation of him as a therapist but then became suddenly angry when she learned that an expected appointment time was not available. This one sample of behavior, which he interpreted as idealization and vilification, led Dr. Rodriguez to conclude that the patient had borderline personality disorder, and this decision influenced how he conceptualized his subsequent treatment decisions.*

Bennett et al. (2006) recommended three patient-focused risk-management strategies to help reduce the likelihood of making a serious clinical error: consultation, documentation, and informed consent. 

Ethical decision-making in the following areas may be particularly susceptible to intuitive and affective influences:
- Multiple Relationships: boundary issues are the most common source of complaints against psychologists, and such problems occur among academics as well as practitioner psychologists
- Risk-management: psychologists use risk management procedures to minimize the likelihood of legal exposure while at the same time maximizing the likelihood of an outcome that promotes the welfare of patients or upholds an overarching ethical or legal obligation
- Training and Supervision: 

**Recommendations:**
- Psychologists should recognize that their initial thoughts might be incorrect.
- Avoid jumping to the first seemingly sufficient solution.
- Actively seek alternative perspectives and consider being their own devil's advocate.
- State the problem in at least two ways and list more than one possible solution.
- Engage in a consultative process to reinforce the final decision.
- Acting ethically should ideally feel good, but often it may not.
- Responsible action requires fulfilling obligations, especially when the analysis is complex and results are unpleasant or unrewarding.
- Dilemmas involve competing emotions, conflicting intuitions, and contending principles.
- Conflict and uncertainty can evoke unpleasant feelings, and stress can increase reliance on intuitive biases.
- Emotional investment is critical in psychological research and practice.
- Emotional attunement is a unique skill that psychologists utilize.
- Emotions and intuitions influence decisions and should be engaged and developed, not ignored.
- Understanding tendencies and biases leads to a more accurate and helpful conceptualization of decision making, especially in emotionally charged situations.
