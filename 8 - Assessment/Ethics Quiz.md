> *A therapist had an intake appointment with a new client. As soon as he looked at the intake form, he realized that she is the ex-wife of his former client. The therapy with the exhusband was brief, and he focused on how he wanted to leave the marriage. The prospective client was using her maiden name and gave no indication during the session that she knew about her ex-husbandâ€™s treatment with the therapist. When asked about the reason for the referral, she said that her physician had referred her for anxiety. She mentions that she is still in communication with her ex-husband because they share three children.*

***Relevant Principles:***
[[Respect for the dignity of persons and peoples]]
- Value 1.6 Privacy and confidentiality.
	- Multiple issues:
		- Unable to disclose conflict of interest to client due to confidential agreement to prior client
		- If therapist feels that they would like to continue seeing the clients then discuss with supervisor of best way to go about this and whether they are justifying in disclosing prior therapeutic relationship with ex husband 
	- Informed consent would not be able to be obtained from new client 
		- Deception may be in play 
	- Rapport may be damaged if ex husband and client finds out they both saw same therapist

[[Responsible Caring]]
- May not be able to conduct a non bias psychological assessment 
- Best to refer on 
- Need to recognise the limit of their competence and that they may not be competent to continue work with this client
- Continue to have regular supervision
- Unable to give client full active participation as unable to provide full information 
[[Integrity In Relationships]]
- Honesty is not able to be given fully 
	- deception may be at play if client continues to see therapist
- Structure of relationships - dual relationships
- CONFLICT OF INTERESTS
- BOUNDARIES - structure of relationships
