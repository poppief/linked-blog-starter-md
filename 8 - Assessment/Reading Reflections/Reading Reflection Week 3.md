I found the Sommers and Flanagan article very informative. I appreciated that they appreciated that what works for one client may not work for another and that there is no "one size fits all" per se. It was fitting, then, that I found myself agreeing with many of their points but also disagreeing with some, reflecting just how important it is to tailor the interview around the client. I was surprised that they suggest maintaining constant eye contact when the client speaks and less constant eye contact when the interviewer speaks. I would think that when someone maintains less eye contact when they are talking, it would suggest that they are nervous or unsure about themselves. 
Whenever I travel or am trying to communicate with someone who does not speak the same language as me, I rely heavily on nonverbal forms of communication, such as hand gestures. However, I do this subconsciously, without thinking. So, I appreciated the "Multicultural Highlight 3.1" as it made me realise just how often we use these techniques in our day-to-day lives.
Mirroring is a technique that I have recognised in my life. For example, a therapist seeing a client who swears a lot may also start to swear to create rapport with the client, such that the client feels that the conversation flows more naturally and the therapist is almost on "their level." 
Reading this article also made me realise how much I want to improve my listening skills. I need to work on holding my attention in a conversation if the topic is not interesting to me. I drift off and will not actively listen to what someone is saying. This can cause me to ask people things they have already told me, but since I was not listening, I did not know. In a professional setting, this is something that could seriously damage rapport. A technique that would be useful would be paraphrasing. This would allow the client to correct me if I have not heard them correctly or missed something they consider important. When we were applying our attending behaviours in class, I found that I was so focused on making sure I was engaging in appropriate attending behaviours that I was not listening to what my partner was saying. 
I appreciate that Sommers and Flanagan acknowledge that these skills come with practice and will become more natural as we practice them.
