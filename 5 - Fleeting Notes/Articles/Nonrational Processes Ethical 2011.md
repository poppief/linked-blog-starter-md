Abstract:  Most current ethical decision-making models provide a logical and reasoned process for making ethical judgments, but these models are empirically unproven and rely upon assumptions of rational, conscious, and quasilegal reasoning. Such models predominate despite the fact that many nonrational factors inﬂuence ethical thought and behavior, including context, perceptions, relationships, emotions, and heuristics. For example, a large body of behavioral research has demonstrated the importance of automatic intuitive and affective processes in decision making and judgment. These processes profoundly affect human behavior and lead to systematic biases and departures from normative theories of rationality. Their inﬂuence represents an important but largely unrecognized component of ethical decision making. We selectively review this work; provide various illustrations; and make recommendations for scientists, trainers, and practitioners to aid them in integrating the understanding of nonrational processes with ethical decision making.

1
Ethical decision-making that realistically accounts for the large number of  contributing factors is an indispensable component of the responsible practice of psychology

1
People often fail to acknowledge their own biases due to a tendency to overvalue introspective information in themselves but not in others

1
Psychologists can improve their decision making by considering a broader array of the factors that can influence judgment and decisions


**Ethical Decision-Making Models**
2
*Kitchener* developed one of the first and most influential models, described two levels of moral reasoning: an intuitive level and a critical-evaluative level.
- ==Intuitive Level==: automatic, pre-reflective responses based upon knowledge and experience guide much of ordinary moral thought and ethical action
- ==Crtiical-evaluative Level==: Decided the ==intuitive level== was not sufficient, presented this level that enhances, directs evaluates, and defends ethical decisions. 
	- Consists of:
		- Reasoned judgments based on philosophical theories
		- Ethical rules, guidelines, standards, and principles 

2
More explicit and extensive models have been developed for more complicated cases
*Haas and Malouf* developed a particularly extensive and detailed model, characterising it as an attempt to describe the process that naturally occurs

2
In the writers view, none have addressed the variables that are embedded within *Kitchener's* intuitive level sufficiently.
