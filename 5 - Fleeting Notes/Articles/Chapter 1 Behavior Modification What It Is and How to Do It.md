**Behaviour** is anything that a person says or does - Technically any muscular, glandular, or electrical activity of an organism.

3
**Products of behaviour** would be like getting an A in a course: the behaviour would be studying hard.

3
**Overt Behaviors** are things that others can witness, they are externalised for example walking, talking out loud etc
**Covert behaviours** are activities that cannot be observed by others. However, in behaviour modification, they are more commonly referred to as activities that occur within one's skin and would require special instruments or procedures for others to observe.
- Things like imagining and private self-talk can also be referred to as **cognitive behaviours** 

Behaviour modification techniques can influence *both*.

Often overt behaviour can be more easily measured and tends to be more important to the individual and society has a whole so is generally the focus of behaviour modifiers


3
**Dimensions of behaviour** are characteristics of behaviour that can be measured
- Duration = the length of time that a behaviour lasts
- Rate = number of instances that the behaviour occurred in a given period
- Intensity = the physical effort or energy involved in doing the behaviour

3
**Behavioural Language** 
Summary labels are used to summarise human actions or the kinds of behaviour that a person is likely to engage in under certain circumstances, like creativity or intelligence. What does it mean if someone says that a person is intelligent? Intelligence is not a behaviour - what the person does that makes them intelligent, i.e. studies hard, or what behaviours make them appear intelligent, such as being very articulate.
- Summary labels are beneficial for providing quick general information about. a person but also may have negative impacts such as how they may be treated, may also lead to *psuedo explanations* of behaviour

3
Authors stress the importance of defining all types of behaviour in terms of:
- **Behavioral deficits** = too little behavior of a particular type
	- Example: A child does not pronounce words clearly and does not interact with other children
- **Behavioral excesses** = too much behavior of a particular type
	- Example: A child frequently gets out of bed and throws tantrums at bedtime, throws food on the floor at mealtime, and hides her mother's tablet
To identify a behavior as excessive or deficient, we must first consider the context in which it occur
Collectively these techniques are referred to as **behaviour modification**

**Behavior modification** (applied behavior analysis): involves the systematic application of learning principles and techniques to assess and improve both covert and overt behaviours, enhancing daily functioning.
Has seven main characteristics:
1. *Emphasis on Measurable Behavior*: Defines probelms in terms of behaviors that can be measured and uses changes in these measures as indicators of progress
2. *Environmental Focus*: Treatment procedures aim to alter the individual's current environment to enhance functioning. Stimuli, which include people, objects, and events, influence behavior
3. *Active Restructuring*: Behavior modifiers actively restructure a client's daily environment to strengthen appropriate behavior, rather than focusing on past experiences.
4. *Precise Methods*: Methods and rationales are precisely described, allowing for replication and consistency in results. This precision also facilitates the teaching of behavior modification techniques.
5. *Everyday application*: Techniques are often applied by individuals in everyday life, such as parents, teachers, and coaches, due to the precise descriptions of behaviour modification procedures
6. *Research-Based Techniques*: Techniques stem from basic and applied research in the science of learning, making them scientifically grounded
7. *Accountability and scientific demonstration*: Emphasizes scientific evidence that interventions are responsible for behavior changes and values accountability for all involved in behavior modification programs
The term "Behavior modifier" generally refers to applied behaviour analysts 
Types of Behavior Modifiers
- **Applied behaivor analysists**
- **Cognitive Behavior Therapists (Behavior Therapists)**
- General population who learn to use principles of behavior modification in daily life

**Behavioral Assessment**:  
- The most important characteristic of behavior modification is its use of measures of behavior to judge whether an individuals behaviour had been improved by a behaviour modification program 
- Involves the collection and analysis of info and data to:
	- Identify and describe target behaviors
	- identify possible causes of the behavior
	- guide selection of an appropriate behavioral treatment
	- evaluate treatment outcome 
5
**Target Behaviors** are behaviours to be improved in a behavior modification program

Other terms used to describe application of learning principles to help individuals improve their behavior include: behavior therapy, applied behavior analysis, and cognitive behavior therapy.

**Pavlovian Conditioning and Early Behavior Therapy:** 
- Ivan Pavlov's experiments demonstrated classical conditioning, where a neutral stimulus paired with a stimulus that elicits a response eventually elicits the response on its own.
- John B. Watson and Rosalie Rayner conditioned a fear response in an infant, while Mary Cover Jones demonstrated the de-conditioning of fear.
- Joseph Wolpe developed treatments for specific phobias using principles of Pavlovian conditioning, leading to the term "behavior therapy."

6 
**Operant Conditioning and Early Behavior Modification**:
- B. F. Skinner distinguished operant conditioning, where behavior is modified by its consequences (rewards and punishments).
- Skinner's principles were applied to various behavioral issues, termed behavior modification.
- Early applications included treating stuttering, reducing regurgitation in children with intellectual disabilities, and teaching children with autism to wear glasses.

6
**Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA)**:
- ABA focuses on measurable, socially significant behavior changes.
- Emphasizes operant conditioning, demonstrating treatment efficacy, and achieving long-lasting behavior improvements.
- ABA is often considered synonymous with **behavior modification.**

6
**Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT)**
- Albert Ellis and Aaron Beck developed approaches focusing on identifying and replacing irrational thoughts with rational ones.
- Ellis and Beck's approaches aim to address dysfunctional thinking to alleviate emotional distress.
- Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) became the common term for these approaches, focusing on altering thought patterns to change behavior and emotions.

**Behavior Analysis**: the study of the scientific laws that govern the behavior of human beings and other animals
