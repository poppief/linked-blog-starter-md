since early 1960s, behavior modification applications in classrooms has progressed
In 1960s Fred S. Keller developed a behavior modification approach to university teaching - since then, variations of behavioral approaches to university teaching have been described
These approaches have three common features:
1. the instructional goals for a course are stated in the form of study questions and application excersicses
2. Students are given opportunities to demonstrate their mastery of the course content through frequent tests or some combination of tests and assignments
3. Students are given detailed information at the beginning of a course about what is expected of them on the tests and assignments in order to achieve various letter grades 
Research has indicated that with these features, the great majority of students are more motivated to remain focused on the task at hand
