**Resilience** = an interactive phenomenon that is inferred from findings indicating that some individuals have a relatively good outcome despite having experienced serous stresses or adversities. With their outcomes being better than that of individuals who suffered the same experiences.

Werner and Smith (1982) pioneers in highlighting importance of resilience and the role of social support as well as the importance of a lifespan approach

Requirement for **environmental mediation** to be tested rather than assumed applies to both risk and protective factors research as much as resilience research
- Focus on identifying whether broad risk factors, such as family break-up, genuinely constitute risks for adverse outcomes 
- It is crucial to verify that a risk factor occurs during the relevant time period to constitute a risk
- The risk effect often stems from related underlying issues, such as conflict or poor parenting, rather than the risk factor itself
- Comparison of different adverse events sugest that associated factors like family conflict pose higher risks than the events themselves
- Poor parenting is identified as a significant risk factor, often more impactful than the presence of the primary risk factor
- Subsequent related issues, such as ongoing conflict, contribute significantly to the risk
**Associated factors, such as family conflict or poor parenting, are often the primary sources of risk for adverse child outcomes rather than the broad risk factors themselves.**

2
Are the risk factors for children environmentally mediated?
Three possible alternatives:
1. genetic mediation - almost all variables that describe environments include a complex mixture of genetic and environmental mediation
2. reverse causation (effects of children on parents rather than the other way around)
3. selection effects (characteristics of those who divorce rather than the divorce as such)

2
 - surprisingly, the effects of parental depression on child depression seem to be primarily environmentally mediated - however, children conduct problems involve a mixture of genetic and environmental mediation

3 
need to pay attention to social context and developmental stage as well
- poor quality daycare is associated with a very slightly increased risk of negative outcomes concerning both scholastic achievement and disruptive behaviour (Vandell, Belsky, Burchina, Steinberg, & Vandergrift, 2010)

3
**The main clinical implication is the requirement to assess individual needs about particular circumstances rather than assume that all risk and protective factors have similar effects in all conditions in all people**

4
Best established risk factors are abuse and neglect, which appear to have a substantial environmentally mediated risk effect on psychopathology

4
Maltreatment (both physical and sexual) and neglect, together with serious family discord and unresolved conflict constitute well established partially environmentally mediated causal effects on psychopathology

**Neutral or Risky Features in the Absence of a Risk Experience**
The idea that resilience can stem from features that are neutral or risky without environmental risk means that certain traits, behaviors, or conditions might not appear beneficial—or could even seem harmful—if they are considered in isolation, without any stressful or adverse context. However, when these features are present in a risky or challenging environment, they can provide significant protective benefits.
For example: Adoption or Long-term stable fostering
- **Without Environmental Risk**: Being adopted is atypical and might carry a slight risk of psychopathological issues because it deviates from the norm of being raised by biological parents.
- **With Environmental Risk**: For children who have been in institutional care or who have experienced serious abuse or neglect, adoption or stable fostering can be a significant protective factor, providing them with a stable and nurturing environment that greatly improves their resilience and overall outcomes.

5
**Brief exposure to risks: Innoculation and coping**
==Resilience may develop from repeated brief negative experiences that allow successful coping==
- Is this true for everyone? What happens if no matter how brief the negative experience is it is still enough to offset some trauma response
Example: Treatment of fears and phobias indicates that avoiding feared objects makes persistence of fear more likely

5
**Mental Features of Resilience**
- Planning tendency - Propensity to plan key life decisions
- Self-reflection: Assessing what has worked and what hasn't - Poor self-control in childhood is associated with negative physical, psychological, and social outcomes - Improvements in self-control over time are linked to better outcomes, suggesting potential benefits from interventions to raise self-control
- Sense of agency: Determination to deal with challenges and self-confidence in doing so 

6
**Turning point effects in Adult Life**
- Traditionally, resilience development is associated with childhood.
- Emerging evidence shows significant turning point effects in adulthood. 
- Turning points refer to critical life changes that lead to positive outcomes, often breaking away from past negative patterns.
- Turning points can lead to better life trajectories by altering social environments and opening new pathways for personal development.
*Speculative elements*
- Precise elements and mechanisms of turning point effects remain speculative.
- Likely involves a dynamic chain of events and experiences 
- Assumed to involve some form of altered biology, although specifics are unknown
- Adult experiences can induce brain changes, contributing to turning-point effects.

**Gene-environment interactions (G x E)**
- Evidence of G-E interactions
	- There have been attempts to deny the reality or practical importance of this interaction however these attempts lack validity.
- Research often focuses on child maltreatment, the MAOA gene, and the serotonin transporter promoter gene (5HTTLPR)
	- The Dunedin studies provide a starting point for these investigations.
- **GXE interactions in Depression and Antisocial Behavior:**
	- Depression: The short allele polymorphism of 5HTTLPR is linked with recurrent negative life events (LE) or early childhood maltreatment
	- Antisocial behaviour: Polymorphism associated with high MAOA activity is linked with maltreatment
	- Specificity: The 5HTTLPR GxE interaction applies only to depression, while the MAOA GxE interaction applies only to antisocial
- Meta-Analysis Findings: 
	- A strong GxE effect is observed for maltreatment, while a marginally significant effect is seen for LE
	- These findings link early childhood experiences to later psychopathology 
	- GxE interactions affect chronic/recurrent depression more than single acute episodes
- Imaging Studies:
	- GxE effects are observed even in individuals without psychopathology
	- Biological pathways related to GxE interactions operate in the general population, not just in those with mental disorders
- Resilience and Genetic factors:
	- Genetic factors play a role in protecting against both depression and antisocial behaviour
	- GXE interactions suggest that resilience is a dynamic process, not a fixed trait
	- The outcome-specific nature of GXE interactions supports the view that resilience is variable and context-dependent
- Evolutionary considerations:
	- Genes likely influence responsivity to both positive and negative environments
	- There is growing empirical support for this perspective
	- Some evidence suggests domain-specificity in susceptibility to environmental influences
- Clinical Implications
	- Genetic polymorphisms associated with vulnerability to adverse environments may also increase responsivity to positive environments
	- Therapeutic interventions can potentially leverage these genetic susceptibilities to improve outcomes

Commitment to social relationships is protective for mental health
Hauser et al (2006) identified social commitment as one of three main features associated with long-term resilience following a mnetal disorder requiring inpatient care 

7
Bowes et al (2010) studied protective effects of family warmth using the Environmental risk (E-risk) longitudinal study of twins
- Maternal warmth, sibling warmth, and a positive family atmosphere were significantly protective against emotional and behavioral disturbances from bullying at ages 10-12 
- Protective effects were stronger in bullied children but also beneficial to nonbullied children
7
A discordant MZ twin strategy showed that maternal warmth had an environmentally mediated protective effect against behavioral problems.
Within MZ twin pairs, the twin receiving more maternal warmth had fewer behavioral problems.

**Concepts of Risk and Resilience**
*Additive Concepts:* The impact of risk factors (such as stressful life events or adverse conditions) tends to affect all individuals in a broadly consistent manner. Each person exposed to the same risk factor would likely experience similar negative outcomes unless protective factors are in place to mitigate those effects. 
- Risk effects are generally uniform across different individuals, however the overall outcome is seen as the sum of all risk and protective factors influencing the individual
*Interactive Concepts*: Outcomes vary widely among individuals because resilience is seen as a dynamic process
- Resilience can be triggered by the presence of risk, leading to different outcomes based on how individuals interact with risk and protective factors
- The same risk factor can lead to different outcomes in different people, reflecting the complexity and variability in how people respond to adversity

9
Resilience should be thought of as the individual has been able to continue on a normal life trajectory despite the adversity

9
Resilience operates on a lifetime basis, so that experiences long after the initial adversity may bring about a restorative effect

9
Resilience may be fostered by exposure to manageable challenges or small doses of a stress experience rather than by avoidance of the environmental hazard

9
Mental features appear prominent in resilience findings (as shown by the effects of personal agency and of planning) - however we should not assume that these are outside of biology 

11
Individual differences in response with adversity may reflect biological pathways influenced by genes

11
Resilience findings do not translate into a clear programme of prevention and treatment, but they do provide numerous leads on clinical approaches that focus on the dynamic view of what may be involved in overcoming seriously adverse experiences.
