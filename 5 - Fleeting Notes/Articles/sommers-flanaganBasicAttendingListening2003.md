> - **Human communication is so complex : "you cannot not communicate" as we are simultaneously sending and receiving messages whenver we are in contact with another person - even a pause communicates something**

> [!quote]+ Note ([Page 1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U777PAD2?page=1&annotation=NYW86BTP))
> - **Human communication has two roles: The sender of the message and the receiver of the message.**

> [!quote]+ Note ([Page 2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U777PAD2?page=2&annotation=KL3VJ5YN))
> - **Attending behaviour is considered by Ivey and Ivey (1999) as the foundation if interviewing - attending behaviours are defined as "culturally and individually appropriate... eye contact, body language, vocal qualities and verbal tracking"**

> [!quote]+ Note ([Page 2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U777PAD2?page=2&annotation=HC6LJ73X))
> - **Nonverbal communication is as important - if not more important than verbal communication**

> [!quote]+ Note ([Page 2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U777PAD2?page=2&annotation=RA2HF4YP))
> - **Most of a clients first impression is based on what they observe of you as they speak**

> [!quote]+ Note ([Page 2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U777PAD2?page=2&annotation=LTSEAFYG))
> - **Good interviewers consciously and deliberately engage in specific behavours that most clients interpret as signs of interest and concern.**

> [!quote]+ Note ([Page 2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U777PAD2?page=2&annotation=QTKM58ZJ))
> - **Porsitive attending behaivors open up communication and encourage free expression
- cultural background and previous experiences affect whether clients view a particular attending behavior as positive or negative- so what works for one client may not work for the next**

> [!quote]+ Note ([Page 3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U777PAD2?page=3&annotation=GVA9V5CW))
> - **Ivey and Ivey (1999) identify four dimensions of simple attending behavior that been studied, to some extent, cross-culturally, they include:
1. Eye contact
2. Body language
3. Vocal qualities
4. Verbal tracking**

> [!quote]+ Note ([Page 3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U777PAD2?page=3&annotation=RK5N5FBC))
> - **Positive interviewer body language-this will vary among individuals and cultures: leaning slightly towards the client, maintaining a relaxed but attentive posutre, placing your feet and legs in an unobtrusive position , keeping your hand gestures unobtrusive and smooth, minimizing the number of other movements, making your facial expressions match your feelings or the clinet's feelings, seating yourself at approximately one arm's length from the client, arranging the furniture to draw you and the client together not to erect a barrier**

> [!quote]+ Note ([Page 3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U777PAD2?page=3&annotation=MWZATPJT))
> - **generally appropriate to maintain more oconstant eye contact as they speak, and less constant eye contact when you speak**

> [!quote]+ Note ([Page 3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U777PAD2?page=3&annotation=4EHHVDM6))
> - **Two aspects of body language:

- kinesics: variables associated with physical features and physical movement of any body part

- proxemics: personal space and environmental variables such as distance between two people and whether any objects are between them**

> - **I really like this take - makes me think of when I travel and have to use nonverbal communication**

> [!quote]+ Note ([Page 4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U777PAD2?page=4&annotation=ECBLHICH))
> - **Mirroring: consistency between interviewer and client - the interviewers physical movements and verbal activity is "in synch with" the client
- this make s me think of therapy and how rob would matchÂ  my energy : even to the extenrt of swearing.**

> ![[image-5-x107-y85.png]]
> - **I feel like this is super challenging for me and something i want to work on, i foudn taht in our class listening task, i was not able to pay attention to what the person was saying as i was so focused on what I was appearing like**

> [!quote]+ Note ([Page 5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U777PAD2?page=5&annotation=IJ556PM3))
> - **Clientswillm not be sure you are listening unless you prove it through accurate verbal tracking

Verbal tracking: pacing the client by sticking closely with client speech content (as well as speech volume and tone, as mentioned previously)**

> [!quote]+ Note ([Page 5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U777PAD2?page=5&annotation=RT7KU7X6))
> - **Interviewers can use tone and speekc==ch rate, as with all interviewer responses and directives, to elad clients toward particular content or feelings**

> [!quote]+ Note ([Page 5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U777PAD2?page=5&annotation=8P6M6CMK))
> - **useful to follow clients lead , spekaing in similar volume and tone to client**

> [!quote]+ Note ([Page 5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U777PAD2?page=5&annotation=46TMUM62))
> - **Paralinguistics: consists of voice loudness, pitch rate and fluency .
Interpersonal influence is oftend etermined not so much by what you say but by how you say it**

> - **Designed to encourage clients to talk freely and openly about hwatever they want to talk about . Similar to attending behaviours, these techniques do not direct or lead clients. They involve the reflection of central client messages back tot he client. BE aware of the powerful influence even supposed nondirective responses have on what clients choose to talk about**

> [!quote]+ Note ([Page 11](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U777PAD2?page=11&annotation=AY9VJL3I))
> - **Silence also allows clients to recover or reflect on what they have just said, it also allows the interview time to consider and intentionally select a response rather than rushing into one.**

> [!quote]+ Note ([Page 11](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U777PAD2?page=11&annotation=IE5ZXBKT))
> - **Silence can be the most nondirective of all listening responses. It takes time for interviewers and clients to get comfortable with silence.**

> [!quote]+ Note ([Page 11](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U777PAD2?page=11&annotation=Q3C9ZXA9))
> - **The primary function of silence as an interviewer response is to encourage client talk**

> - **Paraphrase (or reflection of content) is a verbal tracking skill and a cornerstone of effective communication. Primary purpose = to let clients know you have accurately heard the central meaning of their messages. Secondarily, paraphrases allow clients to hear how someone else perceives them, which can further facilitate expression**

> [!quote]+ Note ([Page 13](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U777PAD2?page=13&annotation=3UMDPGYC))
> - **Paraphrasing is a statement that accurately reflects or rephrases what the client has said. A paraphrase does not change, modify, or add to the client's message. A good paraphrase is accurate and brief.**

> - **The simple paraphrase: does not add meaning or direction, the interview rephrases rewords and reflects what the client just said.**

> ![[image-15-x247-y81.png]]
> - **I really like this!**

> [!quote]+ Note ([Page 15](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U777PAD2?page=15&annotation=QRMHU7GK))
> - **The metaphorical paraphrase: using a metaphor or analogy to capture their client's central message. best suited to kinesthetically oriented clients, however many respond well to them**

> [!quote]+ Note ([Page 16](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U777PAD2?page=16&annotation=VNVHXXWD))
> - **The first form of clarification consists of a restatement of what the client said and a closed question**

> [!quote]+ Note ([Page 16](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U777PAD2?page=16&annotation=93CB6UGT))
> - **The third form of clarification is used when you dont quite hear what the client said and you need to recheck.**

> [!quote]+ Note ([Page 16](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U777PAD2?page=16&annotation=9SM7MCQY))
> - **Brammer (1979) provides two general guidelines for clarifying. First: admit your confusion over what the client has said. Second: try a restatment or ask for clarification, repetition or illustration. Asking for a specific example can be especially useful because it encourages clinets to be concrete and specific rather than abstract and vague**

> [!quote]+ Note ([Page 16](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U777PAD2?page=16&annotation=IJMAZBY2))
> - **Second form of clarification:" a restatement imbedded in a double question (a double question is an either/or question including tow or more choices of response for the client. For example: "Do you dislike being called on in class-or is it something else?"
- this allows interviewers to take more control of what clients say during an interview.**

> [!quote]+ Note ([Page 16](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U777PAD2?page=16&annotation=B3TXJKQE))
> - **Clarification: serve a common purpose: to make clear for yourself and the client the precise nature of what has been said.**

> [!quote]+ Note ([Page 17](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U777PAD2?page=17&annotation=PZDLKBAX))
> - **Nondirective reflection of feeling: main purpose is to let clients know, through an emotionally oriented paraphrase, that you are turned in to their emotional state. They encourage further emotional experession
- basic rule: restate or reflect <b>only</b> the emotional content that you <b>clearly </b>hear the client say. Do not probe, interpret, or speculate**

> [!quote]+ Note ([Page 19](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U777PAD2?page=19&annotation=5YU9XL2G))
> - **Summarization demonstrates accurate listening, enhances client and interviewer recall of major themes, helps clients focus on important issues, and extracts or refines the meaning behind client messages.**

> [!quote]+ Note ([Page 21](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U777PAD2?page=21&annotation=KKL4EU4T))
> - **Feeling validation is <b>not</b> the same as reflection of feeling. it is when an interviewer acknowledges and approves of a client's stated feelings

- All approaches to feeling validation give the same message "your feelings are acceptable and you have permission to feel them"
Some approaches:
- give the message that clients should be having particular feelings, for example, stating that feeling sad and crying are okay or even healthy
- provide through self disclosure , eg disclose that sometimes they also feel nervous about tests: this can be risky though

- <b>universality</b> a concept coined by Yalom and Leszcz: informing the client that nearly everyone else in the world feels what they are feeling**

> [!quote]+ Note ([Page 21](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U777PAD2?page=21&annotation=JHZQMIJM))
> - **Empathy and reassurance are not interchangeable - interviewers should make empathic statements regularly, while reassurance should come in carefully considered, samll doses. Premature reassurence declares that things will improve or come out for the betterm however this cannot be guranteed and can therefore be misleading. Global reassurance may seem to discount the clients difficulties.**

> [!quote]+ Note ([Page 23](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U777PAD2?page=23&annotation=7Z5CKMYR))
> - **Interpretative Reflection of Feeling: feeling-based statemetns madde by interviewers that go beyond the client's overt emiotional expressions witht hte goal to uncover emotions that clients are only partially aware of. eg "i sense that you have some other feelings about this"**

> [!quote]+ Image ([Page 24](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U777PAD2?page=24&annotation=9ND4HEJK))
> ![[image-24-x293-y111.png]]
> - **Classical interpretation requires knowledge of the client and the client's past and present relationships
- poorly timed interpretation can produce resistance and defensiveness**

> [!quote]+ Note ([Page 24](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U777PAD2?page=24&annotation=LWMMZ6QF))
> - **Interpretation: helping something unconscious to become conscious by naming it at the moment it is striving to break through. It is a way of the interviewer saying to the client "this is how I see you and your situation.**

> [!quote]+ Note ([Page 25](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U777PAD2?page=25&annotation=F97BJTAU))
> - **Reframing is used primarily when interviewers believe their clients are viewing the world in a manner that is inaccurate or maladaptive
- reframes promote flexibility in perceiving or interpreting actions**

> [!quote]+ Note ([Page 26](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U777PAD2?page=26&annotation=FHZTTIY6))
> - **The goal of cofrontation is to help clients perceive themselves and reality more clearly.

- Clients often have a distorted view of otehrs, the world, and themselves. These distortions usually manifest themselves as incongruities or discrepancies.

- Confrontation works best when you have a working relationship with the client and ample evidence to demonstrate the client's emotional or behavioral incongruity or discrepancy.

- Helpful to cite evidence to support the confrontation as it increases the likelihood that the client will admit to the discrepancy between his nonverbal behavior and his internal emotions.**
