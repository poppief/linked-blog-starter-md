1
World views may be a hidden variable in math education
***statistical world views*** = how we understand subjective beliefs and personal theories related to math

1
success in maths is influenced by how the person views themselves and their capabilities around maths

1
**Domain specific beliefs** = how beliefs may differ between fields of mathematics

2
Dionne (1984) suggested that world views or beliefs are composed of three basic components:
1. The traditional perspective
2. The formalist perspective
3. The constructivist perspective

2
Ernest (1991) described three views on maths:
1. Instrumentalist
2. Platonist
3. problem solving

2
Torner and Grigutsch (1994) name the three components:
1. toolbox aspect = maths seen as a set of rules, formulae, skills and procedures
2. system aspect = maths is characterized by logic, rigorous proofs, exact definitions and a precise math language
3. process aspect = math is considered a constructive process wehre relations betweend ifferent notions and sentences, as well as the invention or re-invention of math, play an important role

2
This study employed the notions of Torner and Grigutsch (1994)
They also aruged that besides the three standard perspectives, another important component is the usefulness, or utility of mathmatics

3
Study: students asked to use an A4 sheet of paper to describe their views on statistics - aim to capture the initial understanding that students brought to the course. Students were asked to take a blank sheet of A4 paper and draw, write, paint, doodle, or whatever suits them best to express their views on statistics

5
Hierarchy of World views:
Presents the three world views as a hierarchy.
The description for each attempts to justify the hierarchical nature by specifying what is missing in one aspect that puts it below the next aspect
