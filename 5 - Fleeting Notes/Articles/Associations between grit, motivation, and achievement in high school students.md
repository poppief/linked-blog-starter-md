"Given that grit has become such a 'hot' topic, it is important to examine carefully how grit relates to or even overlaps with conceptually similar variables"

Duckworth created Grit-O in 2007, then modified in 2009 to the Grit- S

Questions around whether the two subscales of grit should be combined into a single construct (Grit) or whether they are different enough to be considered separate constructs

In Grit-O it formed two factors that correlated but did not test a higher-order model - in 2009 the Grit-S tested higher order factor models across several samples however these results were inconsistent in their support for a higher-order model

Consistency of interests is not a strong predictor of achievement (operationalised as end of semester-grades), however perseverance of effort significantly predicted achievement

Duckworth describes grit as long term focus however only one item on the grit scale mentions a specific amount of time "I have difficulty maintaining my focus on projects that take more than a few months to complete" so may not be capturing the long term component particularly well
