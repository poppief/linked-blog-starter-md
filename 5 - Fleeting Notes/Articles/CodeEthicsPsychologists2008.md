> Code of Ethics For Psychologists Working in Aotearoa/New Zealand 

> [!quote]+ Highlight ([Page 7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EUV2VVMN?page=7&annotation=EI75QTMT))
> The purposes of the Code are: 1. To unify the practices of the profession. 2. To guide psychologists in ethical decision-making. 3. To present a set of guidelines that might be available to the public in order to inform them of the professional ethics of the profession (for this purpose the summary version of the Code should be used). 

> [!quote]+ Highlight ([Page 7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EUV2VVMN?page=7&annotation=U5DPME69))
> Psychologists should consider the Code when making decisions regarding professional and research practice. Psychologists should also consider any workplace codes of conduct or codes of practice, and relevant legislation. If the Code of Ethics establishes a higher standard of conduct than is required in legislation or other codes, we suggest that psychologists should adopt the higher ethical standard in reaching their decision.

> The Code of Ethics identifies four ethical principles: 1. Respect for the dignity of persons and peoples. 2. Responsible caring. 3. Integrity of relationships. 4. Social justice and responsibility to society

> Subsumed under each Principle are a number of Values that stem from it and these Values are in turn linked to Practice Implications – statements of the appropriate professional behaviours of psychologists in relation to that Value.

> The Practice Implications included are to be considered as guides to practice and should not be understood to exhaust the implications of the associated value for practice.

> . In all circumstances psychologists should proceed as follows: 1. Identify the issues and practices that are ethically relevant Develop alternative courses of action, preferably in consultation with a professional colleague or supervisor. 3. For each identified course of action analyse the likely short-term, ongoing, and long-term risks and benefits for the individual(s) and/or group(s) involved or likely to be affected. 4. Conscientiously apply the principles, values and practice implications to each course of action in the light of the identified risks and benefits and decide which offers the best balance between these. 5. Take the chosen course of action, accepting responsibility for the consequences of the chosen course of action. 6. Evaluate the consequences of the action, correcting negative outcomes if possible and, if the issue(s) originally identified are not resolved, re-engage in the decision making process.

> Principle 1 Respect for the Dignity of Persons and Peoples 

> [!quote]+ Highlight ([Page 10](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EUV2VVMN?page=10&annotation=JUQI4L37))
> The principle of respect for the dignity of persons and peoples requires that each person and all peoples are positively valued in their own right, and are shown respect and granted dignity as part of their common humanity. Respect requires sensitivity to cultural and social diversity and recognition that there are differences among persons associated with their culture, nationality, ethnicity, colour, race, religion, gender, marital status, sexual orientation, physical or mental abilities, age, socio-economic status, and/or any other personal characteristic, condition, or status. Such differences are an integral part of the person. In New Zealand, the basis for respect between the indigenous people (tangata whenua – those who are Māori) and others (those who are not Māori) is set out in the Treaty of Waitangi.

> Principle 2 Responsible Caring The practice of psychology promotes well-being. In pursuing this goal, psychologists demonstrate an active concern for the welfare of those with whom they work and acknowledge the social and institutional power that structures their role as psychologists. Psychologists have a primary responsibility to protect the welfare of those with whom they work. They recognise that individuals, families, groups, hapū/iwi, or communities, may be in a vulnerable position. In New Zealand, the Treaty of Waitangi provides a framework for responsible caring between the two peoples, tangata whenua (those who are Māori) and those who are not Māori.

> Principle 3 Integrity in Relationships The relationships formed by psychologists in the course of their work embody explicit and mutual expectations of integrity that are vital to the advancement of social justice, scientific knowledge, and to the maintenance of public confidence in the discipline of psychology. Expectations of professional practice include: respect, accuracy and honesty; openness, maintenance of appropriate boundaries, and avoidance of conflicts of interest. Psychologists will seek to do right in their relations with others. In New Zealand, the Treaty of Waitangi provides a framework for integrity in relationships between the two peoples, tangata whenua (those who are Māori) and those who are not Māori.

> Principle 4 Social Justice and Responsibility to Society Psychology functions as a discipline to promote the well being of society. In New Zealand, the Treaty ofWaitangi is a foundation document of social justice. Psychologists, both as individuals and as a group, have responsibilities to the community and to society in general. The principle of social justice is about acknowledging psychologists’ position of power and influence in relation both to individuals and groups within communities where the psychologist is involved, and in the broader context. It is about addressing and challenging unjust societal norms and behaviours that disempower people at all levels of interaction.
