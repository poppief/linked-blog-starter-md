Like the [[THE “A4-PROJECT” - STATISTICAL WORLD VIEWS EXPRESSED THROUGH PICTURES]] they employed the three components by Torner and Grigutsch (1994)

1
Utility of maths is relevant in stats where critical statistical literacy involves "questioning engagement with context" 

2
**Statistical literacy** : "is the ability to understand and critically evaluate statistical results that permeate our daily lives – coupled with the ability to appreciate the contributions that statistical thinking can make in public and private, professional and personal decisions" Wallman (1993)

2
Six levels of statisstical literacy as a hierarchical construct were identified by Watson and Callingham (2003). The lowest level called "idiosyncratic", suggesting a lack of engagement with their associated ideas and contexts. The middle level is "consistent", where students demonstrated an appropriate but non-critical engagement with context. The highest level is called "critical mathematical," demanding critical questioning engagement with context, showing appreciation of the need for uncertainty in making predictions, and interpreting subtle aspects of language

2
Used same concept of A4 project as the original study 

2
This analysis was based on three categories that were identified in the earlier study and tried to put all 164 pictures in one of the categories : A, B , and C2 were from original study. C1, and G were identified in this study.

Some thoughts:
- One huge limitation I can see with this is that I think level of artistry would be a large confounding factor. People who are less artistic/ do not view themselves as artistic or creative may be less inclined to put effort in and as such, the picture does not actually reflect their views of stats
- Interesting would be sto see if their view changes from the start to the end of the course
